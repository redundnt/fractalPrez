# Fractal Presentation

## Creating
Included is a Makefile - on *nix systems you navigate to the home directory and
enter
<pre>make</pre>
and you should get a spiffy new pdf file entitled `FractalPres.pdf`. There are
some dependencies that I've included in a `headings.tex` file.

## Layout
The `FractalPres.pdf` starts off with an intro on fractals and then goes on to
talk about some notions such as a few select mathematical properties and the
presence of fractals in artwork. This is a very wide topic and gets very deep
very quickly. 

## Some Themes
One of the main themes in the study of fractals is the notion of self-similarity.
This is, of course, inextricable linked with the notions of self-reference (both
int the generation and the structure of fractals), and with the concept of
infinity.
