# Fractal Presentation
Created for UMass's History of Mathematics course, Spring 2016.
You can view the PDF here but it cannot be downloaded and the links don't work. 
You can access downloadable/interactive version of the PDF visit

## Creating
Included is a Makefile - on *nix systems you navigate to the home directory and
enter
<pre>make</pre>
and you should get a spiffy new pdf file entitled `FractalPres.pdf`. There are
some dependencies that I've included in a `headings.tex` file. I've installed
the full `texlive` distribution and I'm not sure what I need and what is 
superfluous.

## Layout
The `FractalPres.pdf` starts off with an intro on fractals and then goes on to
talk about some notions such as a few select mathematical properties and the
presence of fractals in artwork. This is a very wide topic and gets very deep
very quickly.  As such my treatment is topical and very incomplete. 

## Some Themes
One of the main themes in the study of fractals is the notion of self-similarity.
This is, of course, inextricable linked with the notions of self-reference (both
in the generation and the structure of fractals), and with the concept of
infinity.
